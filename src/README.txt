Provides developers with powerful and flexible tools for managing post and user custom fields.


== Description ==

This plugin is aimed at plugin and theme developers who want a set of tools that allows them to easily and flexibly define custom fields for all post types, and for user profiles.

Code hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/pilau/developers-custom-fields).

Issue tracking on [GitHub](https://github.com/pilau/developers-custom-fields/issues). If you're not sure if you've found a genuine issue or not, please start a thread on the [WP forum](http://wordpress.org/tags/pilau-developers-custom-fields).

Please note that this plugin isn't suitable for non-developers. It has been intentionally designed without a user interface for defining fields, and some aspects may be 'unfriendly' to anyone not comfortable with hands-on WordPress development.
